# Inflammation Disease Diagnosis using Naive Bayes Classifier

## Project Overview
This project uses a Naive Bayes classifier to diagnose inflammation-related diseases based on symptoms like temperature, nausea, pain, and others. The goal is to predict the presence of diseases such as nephritis or urinary tract infection.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- `temperature`, `nausea`, `lumbar_pain`, etc.
- Target variable: `disease` (combination of `inflammation` and `nephritis`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

git clone https://github.com/VishalGawale/ml-naive-bayes-medical-diagnosis.git
cd ml-naive-bayes-medical-diagnosis
pip install -r requirements.txt
